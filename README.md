# Gesture Based UI Development
This repository consists of the project which I have created for module Gesture Based UI Development to encorporate voice controls and a state machine to determine the outcome of a game. The game I have developed is a clone and tweak of the Pokemon series battle sequences. The game is controlled by using voice commands and a state machine will determien whos turn it is to perform an action and also determine the winner/loser of the battle.

## Requirements

* United States Windows Language Settings.

* Visual Studio Code
* Unity 2D
